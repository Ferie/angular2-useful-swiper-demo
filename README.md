# angular2-useful-swiper-demo

`angular2-useful-swiper` is a wrapper for [idangerous Swiper](http://idangero.us/swiper/get-started/) in Angular.

In this repository there are some examples that show how to use it in different cases.

For example, images can loop in a carousel, or the transition between the slides can start automatically, etc.

See [angular2-useful-swiper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2-useful-swiper) for more details about the Angular wrapper.

See [Swiper API](http://idangero.us/swiper/api/) for all the options available for the Swiper.
